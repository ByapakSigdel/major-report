\section{Expected Output}

 The project aims to develop an innovative interactive gesture-controlled gaming system that
 translates real-hand movements into precise in-game character actions. The primary output will
 be a custom-designed wearable interface integrating MPU sensors, and mechanical switches
 enabling accurate hand gesture detection. The system will facilitate real-time data transmission
 between hardware and gameengine, creating an immersive first-person gaming experience with
 minimal latency. Key deliverables include a responsive input mechanism, gesture recognition
 algorithm, and puzzle game prototype demonstrating seamless hardware-software interaction.
 The project seeks to achieve 90 percent gesture detection accuracy, showcasing potential ad
vancements in interactive gaming technologies through innovative human-computer interface
 design.
